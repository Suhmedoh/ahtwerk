mpd
mpc
feh

how it works:
super simple setup, broken up into a couple different pieces. ahtwerk is the program that grabs the current artwork using sp, which is tweaked so calling "sp feh" will spawn the artwork in a window at a certain position with no window decorations. "sp current" gets the now playing info, the script compares it to the last currently playing info, and when it's different, it grabs the new album art and changes the artist/album/song.

I'm not claiming this is coded well, or efficient, or anything.  If it deletes system32 or w/e i take no responsibility
